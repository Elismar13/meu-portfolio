# 🛠️ Personal Website/Portfolio

## 📚 Introduction to Personal Website/Portfolio

This is my personal website and portfolio, built as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using React, TypeScript, and Vite. With this website, I aim to showcase my skills, experience, and projects in a clear and concise manner.

## 🤔 How it Works

My personal website is built as a SPA, utilizing React for the frontend, TypeScript for type checking, and Vite for development and build purposes. The application is divided into several sections, each with its own functionality. The website is designed to be easy to use and provide a seamless user experience.
